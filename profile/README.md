# Decision Contracts

**Smarter contracts make decisions**

---

## Why bother with Decision Contracts on blockchains?

### Introduction

As an introduction, we would like to cite an excerpt from Stephan Haarmann's [article][1]:

> _"Recently blockchain technology has been introduced to **execute interacting business
> processes** in a secure and transparent way. While the foundations for process
> enactment on blockchain have been researched, the execution of decisions on
> blockchain has not been addressed yet. In this paper we argue that **decisions are an
> essential aspect of interacting business processes**, and, therefore, also need to be
> executed on blockchain. The **immutable** representation of decision logic can be used by
> the interacting processes, so that decision taking will be more **secure**, more
> *transparent**, and better **auditable**."_

### Key takeaways

- Business processes are already executed on blockchains as **Smart Contracts**.
- Non-trivial **business processes** need non-trivial **decisions** during their execution.
- Decisions are **essential** for interacting business processes.
- Decision logic must be **immutable** to be **secure**, **transparent** and **auditable**.
- Decisions should be separated from the business process logic as **Decision Contracts**.
