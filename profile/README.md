# Decision Contracts

**Smarter contracts make decisions**

## Why bother with Decision Contracts?

As an answer, I would like to cite an excerpt from Stephan Haarmann's [article][1]:

> _"Recently blockchain technology has been introduced to **execute interacting business
> processes** in a secure and transparent way. While the foundations for process
> enactment on blockchain have been researched, the execution of decisions on
> blockchain has not been addressed yet. In this paper we argue that **decisions are an
> essential aspect of interacting business processes**, and, therefore, also need to be
> executed on blockchain. The **immutable** representation of decision logic can be used by
> the interacting processes, so that decision taking will be more **secure**, more
> *transparent**, and better **auditable**."_
